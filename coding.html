            <h3>My Projects</h3>
            <h3>This Website!</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-size">
                This website was an idea of mine to be a cetral location for interested parties to find out what I'm all about.
                My goal for this was to make a beautiful, responive website that can catch the eye of the user, while not being
                overly flashy or hard to use. For the website, I only used vanilla HTML and CSS to achieve the website. A big challenge
                in making this was making it responsive, as this was a gap in my knowledge that I knew I had, but I wanted to overcome
                and make the website as mobile friendly as possible.

            <h3>Weather App</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-size">
                My weather app is a small project I worked on to get my hands dirty in calling and using data from an API.
                This is a web-based app that lets the user input a city, state, and country and then displays the current weather of that location.
                The API I worked with for this project was OpenWeather which gave me weather data for whatever city I queried.
                To build the app, I used HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript as well as Postman to test requests. Using Javascript, I created get requests to the API
                which returned weather data in a JSON format which I needed to manipluate to show to the user.

            <h3>Fantasy Football Team Builder</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-size">
                This is the project I am currently working on. For context on how I chose this project, my dad and I are in a Fantasy Football
                league where the draft is mostly done with paper. This can make it challenging to keep track of what players have been picked to what
                team, as well as who is left to be picked and who would be the best option. This got me thinking and gave me the idea to make a web-based app
                that would do the sorting and above housekeeping for us, so that we can focus on who we want to draft. I am making this app using JavaScript, React, Node.JS, and CSS
                and will be deciding a database platform I can use to house all the player information. I am using that project also as a way to master React, the reusable
                components that React offers seem to be a perfect fit for an app that will need to display plenty of player data in a short amount of time.
