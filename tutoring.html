                Outside of school and my hourly job, I also tutor! I teach both math and coding to middle school and high school kids
                who just need that extra little push to be great at their subject. My coding course can also be used as a great introduction
                for kids interested in programming and computer science.

            <h3>Math</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-size">
                Starting off in middle school, I wasn't very strong in math.
                However, as I grew I realized how important math would be in my life, school, and work life.
                So I decided through hard work and studying, I would get to be good at
                math no matter what it took. Now, I am a third year computer science student getting a 
                minor in mathematics. I know what it is like to struggle understanding math, or even just
                needing that little extra push to really understand a concept. This gives me a unique understanding
                of my students needs and allows me to connect with them more through our lessons. I can teach any middle school math
                as well as high school algebra through calculus. If there is a subject you have questions about, feel free to e-mail me!
            </p>

            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-size">
                I was introduced to coding in 8th grade by our computer teacher which sparked an interest in technology and programming into high school.
                While in high school, I would dabble here and there learning simple technologies and coding priciples, but in college I really ran with this interest
                and am majoring in computer science. As for what I can teach, the coding languages I know can be found on the coding page, along with those, I can teach
                various areas of programming as well. Some of which are Web Design, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Browser-Based, and Game Design. If you 
                have any questions about other subjects, send me an e-mail, I would also be open to learning new subjects per request!
